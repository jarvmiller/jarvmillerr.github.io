<p>This is a continuation of the previous post. I took the same ‘majority minority’ zip codes and decided what else I could add. 
One available dataset I could find was from the IRS. It included the 100 lowest and highest earning zip codes each. I also did some 
more web scraping and found all the Planned Parenthood locations in America and converted those to lat-long coordinates (messy code 
means unnecessary for loops and long computation time. I’ll clean it up later). I did this because I’ve frequently heard people mention 
how they don’t have a problem with Planned Parenthood, but they just don’t like how the organization targets minority communities.
I won’t list the statistics or stories I’ve heard because they were never validated but I decided to take primary glance. I looked at
the PP locations overlaid on top of the low vs high income zips as well as the ‘minority majority’ zips. The two maps are below</p>
<img src = "images/pp.income.png" alt = "pp.income" />
<img src = "images/pp.minority.png" alt = "pp.minority" />

<p>You can see that there is some overlap between PP locations and ‘majority minority’ zips but that’s generally in cities with a huge 
population so that’s not surprising that they’re there. I’m not here to say ‘Wow, definitely targeting minorities” or not, I’m just 
here to display the data and let you make your own decision. To further improve this preliminary analysis, I’d probably have to 
everything withing a certain radius that depends on each state’s density. However, I have no idea what radius to use so this is all
that I’m doing for now. Maybe I’ll pick this up later when I show a social scientist or someone who is just more educated about these 
topics in general haha.</p>

<p>On a another (small) note, I also looked at which zip codes from the 100 lowest income list were in the list of ‘majority minority’ 
zips and <strong><u>93 out of the 100 matched</u></strong>. I did the same with the 100 highest income and 3 out of the 100 matched with the ‘majority minority’
zips. Crazy!</p>

<p>I was supremely bored during this winter break and decided to have some fun with a little data. I discovered the heaven-sent rvest
package created by Hadley Wickham and learned some web scraping. I went to zipatlas.com and was able to find and ordered list of zipcodes
with the highest percentage of African-Americans in the US. After some scraping and cleaning, I kept every zip that had at least 25% 
black and had a population above the median and did the same for zip codes with the highest percentage of Hispanics in the US. I found 
which zip codes between the two matched and stored those as well as the zip codes that were at least 50% Black or Hispanic so that I 
had all zip codes that were either 50% Black, Hispanic, or both.</p>

<p>Plotting time! I used ggplot to plot the zipcodes and it looks very pretty to me. Let me know what you think. My next post will 
explore these zip codes a bit further so be on the lookout!</p>
