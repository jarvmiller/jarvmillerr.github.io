<p> I was supremely bored during this winter break and decided to have some fun with a little data. I discovered the heaven-sent <i>rvest</i>
package created by Hadley Wickham and learned some web scraping. I went to <a href = "https://zipatlas.com" target = "_blank">zipatlas.com</a> and was able to find an ordered list of 
zip codes with the highest percentage of African-Americans in the US. After some scraping and cleaning, I kept every zip that had at 
least 25% black and had a population above the median and did the same for zip codes with the highest percentage of Hispanics in the 
US. I found which zip codes between the two matched and stored those as well as the zip codes that were at least 50% Black or Hispanic 
so that I had all zip codes that were either 50% Black, Hispanic, or both.</p>

<p>Plotting time! I used ggplot to plot the zipcodes and it looks very pretty to me. Let me know what you think. My next post will explore these zip codes a bit further so be on the lookout!</p>
